# self-balancing-bot
Closed-loop control implementation of an inverted pendulum (self-balancing robot) using ESP32, MPU6050 sensor fusion, and PID stabilization.
# Self Balancing Robot

## Overview
This project implements a two-wheel self-balancing robot based on the inverted pendulum model. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller, MPU6050 IMU for tilt estimation, and PID control for stabilization.

## Objectives
- Implement real-time tilt estimation
- Design closed-loop PID controller
- Develop stable motor control
- Add monitoring interface (future phase)

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 Dev Board
- MPU6050 IMU
- TB6612FNG Motor Driver
- 2x DC Gear Motors
- 2S Li-ion Battery
- Buck Converter

## Project Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: System Planning
- [ ] Phase 2: Sensor Integration
- [ ] Phase 3: PID Implementation
- [ ] Phase 4: Stabilization
- [ ] Phase 5: Monitoring Interface
